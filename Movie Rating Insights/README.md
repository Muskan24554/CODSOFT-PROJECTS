## Movie Rating Insights Dashboard
## Project Objective
Analyze movie rating data to uncover patterns in audience engagement, voting behavior, and genre/rating trends.

Provide actionable insights on which movies, actors, directors, and genres resonate most with viewers.

Enable stakeholders to distinguish between popularity (votes) and critical acclaim (ratings) for informed decision-making.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Total Director: 15.5K (count of directors represented)

Average Votes per Movie: 990.3

Average Rating per Movie: 2.98

Top Movies by Total Votes

## Project Objective

Data Collection & Cleaning: Aggregated movie records with director, actor, vote, and rating information; cleaned and standardized entries.

Data Modeling: Built relationships for dynamic filtering by year, actor, and director.

Dashboard Development: Designed visual reporting tools in Power BI—bar charts for top movies and actors, line charts for rating/vote distribution, genre analysis.

Applied Dynamic Slicers: Enabled users to slice data by year, actor, and director to explore custom insights.

## Project Insights
Engagement Patterns: A small number of blockbuster titles attract most audience votes, creating a “long-tail” engagement distribution.

Ratings vs. Votes: High ratings do not always correspond to high vote totals—quality and popularity are not synonymous.

Weighting for True Insights: Weighting ratings by vote count or setting a minimum threshold brings forward truly loved titles, not just niche favorites.

Genre Trends: Certain genres (e.g., History, Romance) earn higher average ratings, whereas others (e.g., Comedy, Animation) tend to accumulate more votes, revealing audience versus critic preferences.

## Final Conclusion
The dashboard enables stakeholders to differentiate between quality and popularity.

High engagement is often focused on very few blockbuster movies, but critically acclaimed films may not always be the most popular.

By using minimum vote thresholds and weighted ratings, analysts can identify genuinely well-received titles.

Stakeholders can use these insights to guide marketing, production, and curation decisions based on both engagement and critical reception.
