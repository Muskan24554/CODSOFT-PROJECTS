## IRIS Flower Classification - Interactive dashboard using PowerBI
## Project Objective:
-Visualize and analyze the IRIS flower dataset interactively.
-Allow users to dynamically filter by species and key features (petal length, sepal length).
-Compare species patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.
-Present key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights into the dataset.
## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
-Average Sepal Length: 3.76
-Average Petal Length: 5.84
-Count of ID (records): 150
-Count of Species: 3
## Process
-Data Preparation: Clean and organize the IRIS dataset for dashboard analysis.
-Dashboard Design: Use dynamic slicers for filtering by species, petal length, and sepal length.
-Visualization: Overlay multiple charts (bar, line, pie) to compare features and species patterns.
-Calculation of KPIs: Aggregate data for average lengths and total counts.
-User Experience Tuning: Enable interactive exploration with filters and slicers.
