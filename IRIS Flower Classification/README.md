## IRIS Flower Classification - Interactive dashboard using Power BI
## Project Objective:
-Visualize and analyze the IRIS flower dataset interactively.

-Allow users to dynamically filter by species and key features (petal length, sepal length).

-Compare species patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.

-Present key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights into the dataset.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):

-Average Sepal Length: 3.76

-Average Petal Length: 5.84

-Count of ID (records): 150

-Count of Species: 3

## Process
-Data Preparation: Clean and organize the IRIS dataset for dashboard analysis.

-Dashboard Design: Use dynamic slicers for filtering by species, petal length, and sepal length.

-Visualization: Overlay multiple charts (bar, line, pie) to compare features and species patterns.

-Calculation of KPIs: Aggregate data for average lengths and total counts.

-User Experience Tuning: Enable interactive exploration with filters and slicers.

## Project Insights:

-Species Distribution: Pie charts reveal that Iris-virginica has the largest share of petal length, while Iris-setosa has the smallest.

-Feature Patterns: Bar and line charts uncover how petal/sepal lengths vary among species, helping to distinguish species patterns.

-Dynamic Exploration: Slicers empower users to explore detailed species breakdowns and investigate correlations interactively.

-KPIs highlight important dataset metrics and facilitate quick understanding of feature averages and dataset size.

## Skills Used
